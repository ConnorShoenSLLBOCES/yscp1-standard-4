price = float(input("Enter the price of the item: "))
# Use complex conditions to calculate the tax rate
if price < 100:
    tax = price * .08
    print (f"The tax is {tax:.2f}")
    total = tax + price
    print (f"Your total is {total:.2f}")
else:
    tax = price *.1
    print (f"The tax is {tax:.2f}")
    total = tax + price
    print (f"Your total is {total:.2f}")
